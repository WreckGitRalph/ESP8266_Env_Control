# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"

config_schema:
  - ["i2c.enable",true]
  - ["i2c.sda_gpio",0]
  - ["i2c.scl_gpio",2]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
